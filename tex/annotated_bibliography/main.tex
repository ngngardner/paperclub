  \begin{itemize}
    \item Model-based learning for images (high dimensional input) that uses
      latent space representation (low dimensional)
    \item Main contributions: trains the encoder, decoder, and transition model
      simultaneously, which allows them to set a restriction for local linearity
      for the transition dynamics
    \item The resulting encoder produces good representation spaces. They use KL
      divergence to make sure the model stays in relevant space.
  \end{itemize}}

\annotate{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1906-08253}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Introduces technique where they use the dynamics-model in short
      runs, branching frequently from runs using "real life" data. They keep
      separate replay buffers for model-generated data and the real
      environment data
    \item It improves the sample efficiency, and avoids overfitting to data
      in the "real data" replay buffer which may have few samples
    \item They were comparing usefulness of off-policy real data versus
      on-policy model-generated data. They found that branches of 0 length
      were best in theory, but in practice, branches of length 1 were most
      helpful
